    Access Tokens
      Access tokens are secure strings used for authenticating access to
      resources and services. This part will explain generating access tokens
      for services like Azure, GitHub, and Anaconda Cloud, and managing them
      efficiently.

    DevOps
      DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT
      operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and
      provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

    Version Control
      Version control systems track file changes over time. This section covers
      the basics of Git, including repository setup, commits, remote changes,
      branches, and pull requests.

    Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
      CI/CD involves automatic building, testing, and deploying code changes.
      This segment discusses setting up CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and
      efficient deployment.

    Environment Variables
       Named values in a computer's environment that influence the behavior of
       running processes. These variables store system settings and user
       preferences, guiding how software operates.

    Persistent Environment Variables
       Variables that remain active across multiple sessions and survive system
       restarts. Common in Unix and Windows, these are set in system or user
       profiles, ensuring consistent availability for essential settings like
       system paths.

    Temporary Environment Variables
       Variables set temporarily for a single session or process. They cease to
       exist once the session or process ends. Often used in scripts or
       command-line sessions, they allow for temporary adjustments to a
       process's behavior without altering permanent settings.

    Conda
      `Conda <https://conda.io/en/latest/>`_ is an open-source, cross-platform
      package manager and environment management system. It is designed to
      simplify the installation and management of software packages and their
      dependencies. Conda is language-agnostic, but it is often used for Python
      projects.

    Anaconda
      `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ is a
      distribution of Python and R languages geared toward scientific computing
      and data science. Anaconda comes with Conda, its package manager, and
      includes a wide array of pre-installed packages for various computing
      tasks.

    Miniconda
      `Miniconda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ is a
      minimal installer for Conda. Unlike Anaconda, it doesn't come with a
      pre-set library of scientific packages, giving you the freedom to install
      only the packages you need.

    Conda-forge
      `Conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_ is a community-driven
      repository of Conda packages. It provides a unified channel to distribute
      software that may not be available in the default Conda channels.

    Conda-smithy
      `Conda-smithy <https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-smithy>`_ is a tool
      used to manage multiple feedstocks for Conda-forge packages. It automates
      the configuration of continuous integration services used to build Conda
      packages.

    Feedstock
      A feedstock is a repository that contains the build recipes for one or
      more Conda packages. Managed by Conda-smithy, feedstocks are the building
      blocks for creating and maintaining Conda packages on Conda-forge.

    Package
      In the context of Conda, a package is a bundled set of software binaries,
      libraries, or scripts, along with metadata and dependencies, which can be
      installed into a Conda environment.

    Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)
      CI/CD involves automatic building, testing, and deploying code changes.
      This segment discusses setting up CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and
      efficient deployment.
