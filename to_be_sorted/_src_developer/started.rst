Installing Dependencies
-----------------------

In order to develop for ``tudat`` or ``tudatpy``, the dependencies must be
satisfied for building each project. To make this consistent, the following
environment files are provided.

- If developing ``tudatpy``, install ``tudatpy-devel.yaml`` (:download:`yaml <_static/tudatpy-devel.yaml>`)
- If developing ``tudat``, install ``tudat-devel.yaml`` (:download:`yaml <_static/tudat-devel.yaml>`)

.. note::

    You can install a conda environment by navigating to the containing directory and executing:

    .. code-block:: bash

        conda env create -f file-name.yml
